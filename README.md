# Action-based-recommendation-in-Pull-request-development
Pull requests (PRs) selection is a challenging task faced by integrators in pull-based development (PbD), with hundreds of PRs submitted on a daily basis to large open-source projects. Managing these PRs manually consumes integratorsâ€™ time and resources and may lead to delays in the acceptance, response, or rejection of PRs that can propose bug fixes or feature enhancements. On the one hand, well-known platforms for performing PbD, like GitHub, do not provide built-in recommendation mechanisms for facilitating the management of PRs. On the other hand, prior research on PRs recommendation has focused on the likelihood of either a PR being accepted or receive a response by the integrator. In this paper, we consider both those likelihoods, this to help integrators in the PRs selection process by suggesting to them the appropriate actions to undertake on each specific PR. To this aim we propose an approach, called CARTESIAN (aCceptance And Response classificaTion-based requESt IdentifcAtioN) modeling the PRs recommendation according to PR actions.
